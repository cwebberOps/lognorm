SYNPOSIS

lognorm policyfile < logdata

DESCRIPTION

lognorm applies a policy file to lines read from STDIN. Statements in the
policy file consist of a list of actions preceding conditions,
expressed as regular expressions and/or assignments. If all conditions are
matched, each action is executed in sequence. If any condition fails,
or any action fails, the statement evaluation ends.

EXAMPLES

This example populates a table, userCount, keyed on the "user" variable.
The userCount for the variable user is incremented for each line matching
the supplied regular expression on stdin.

  count userCount[user]
  when user=/username (\S+)/

This example populates a table, ipUserCount, keyed on the "user" variable.
This example demonstrates assigning to multiple variables, and then using
them in the table.

  count ipUserCount[ip,user]
  when ip,user=/ip (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+) username (\S+)/
